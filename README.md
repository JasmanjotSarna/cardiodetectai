# 🫀 CardioDetect — Clinical Intelligence & Cardiovascular Research Console

### *Every heartbeat leaves a clue.*

**CardioDetect** is a medical-technology web platform designed to explore cardiovascular disease risk classification through radical algorithmic interpretability. Built on a reproducible Scikit-Learn K-Nearest Neighbors pipeline (`k=5`), FastAPI backend, and an interactive React 19 / Vite 8 frontend.

> **Institutional Medical Notice:** CardioDetect is an experimental cardiovascular health research and educational platform exploring machine-learning-assisted classification using clinical indicators. Predictions are generated via a 5-Nearest Neighbors estimator trained on historical cohorts (918 cases). This tool is strictly non-diagnostic and does not replace professional clinical evaluation, coronary angiography, stress echocardiography, or physician guidance.

## ✨ System Architecture & Capabilities

### 🏛️ Dedicated Route Architecture (React Router + AnimatePresence)
- **`/` Home (Product Landing):** 12-column split hero with the **Pulse Field Canvas** (flowing ECG ribbon + reactive particle grid + traveling pulse bead), live stats ticker strip, 3-step scroll story, interactive mini-demo calling real `/api/predict`, bento grid of capabilities, and institutional ethics band.
- **`/assess` Clinical Console:** Serious, high-precision clinical interface featuring an ethics consent gate, 4-phase stepper (*Intake*, *Vitals & Chemistry*, *Cardiac & Exercise*, *Case Review*), and the **Signature Patient Monitor** (real-time canvas ECG adapting sweep speed to MaxHR and wave geometry to ST Slope/Oldpeak/Angina, alongside real-time zone gauges).
- **`/report` Case Report & Sensitivity Simulator:** Verdict banner first (icon + high-contrast text, never color alone), honest KNN 5-dot consensus (strictly discrete 0/20/40/60/80/100% probabilities), **5 Similar Patient Cards** (authentic training cases with comparative biomarkers), contributing factors breakdown, **What-If Sensitivity Simulator** with debounced real-time re-inference, and dedicated print stylesheet.
- **`/insights` Model Rigor & Dataset Explorer:** Holdout test metrics with count-up animations, continuous ROC curve (`AUC = 0.9269`) with marked operating threshold, 2×2 confusion matrix with sequential fill, and interactive 4-tab **Dataset Explorer** computed live from `heart.csv` via `/api/dataset-stats` (Class Balance, Age/MaxHR Distributions, Scatter, Categorical Breakdowns, Correlation Heatmap).
- **`/science` Inside the Model:** 6-stage scikit-learn pipeline walkthrough with vertical progress rail, LaTeX formulations, and **Interactive 2D Coordinate Space Plot** (click or arrow-key query positioning, k=3/5/7 neighbor tuning).
- **`/about` Method, Dataset & Ethics:** Verified dataset provenance (918 cases from Cleveland, Hungarian, Swiss, and Long Beach centers), plain-language model mechanics, sample size and 20% discrete granularity limitations, algorithmic fairness safeguards, and formal disclaimers.
- **`*` 404 Signal Lost:** Flatline ECG display (0 BPM) that pulses into a sinus rhythm when hovering or clicking the return action.

### 🎨 Design Tokens & Aesthetics
- **Dark Mode (Default):** Deep midnight navy canvas (`#080D1A`), frosted-glass panels (`rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.7)`), 1px translucent borders (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`), restrained cyan (`#45D9E8`), medical green (`#48D597`), and coral red (`#FF5267`) telemetry glows.
- **Light Mode:** Crisp medical canvas (`#F8FAFC`), porcelain elevated cards (`#FFFFFF`), hairline borders (`#E2E8F0`), and high-contrast charcoal typography (`#0F172A`).
- **Layout System:** Asymmetric 12-column fluid grid up to ~1440px container (`.site-container-wide`) with subtle blueprint grid lines (`.blueprint-grid-canvas`), technical margin coordinates, and monospace metadata badges.
- **Command Palette (`Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K`):** Global modal for instant page navigation, dark/light theme switching, and quick-loading of patient presets (Healthy, Moderate, Acute Ischemia).

## 🚀 Local Setup & Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.10+ (Virtual environment `.venv` recommended)

### 1. Start the FastAPI Backend
```bash
# From project root
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn api:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
- Health check: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health`
- Dataset stats: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/dataset-stats`
- Interactive Swagger docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

### 2. Start the React Frontend
```bash
# In another terminal from frontend/
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend launches at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Production Build Validation & Automated Verification
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx oxlint

# Run end-to-end headless browser verification & update multi-viewport screenshots:
node scripts/verify_browser.mjs
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### `GET /api/health`
Returns pipeline status, model parameters, and verified holdout test metrics.

### `GET /api/dataset-stats` *(New additive endpoint)*
Computes empirical cohort statistics directly from the 918 records in `heart.csv`:
- Total records and class balance (410 healthy / 508 heart disease).
- Binned Age and MaxHR distributions split by diagnosis.
- Categorical breakdowns for `ChestPainType` and `ST_Slope`.
- 120-point representative patient scatter sample.
- Pairwise Pearson correlation matrix across continuous physiological markers.

### `GET /api/metrics`
Returns holdout test accuracy (86.41%), ROC-AUC (0.9269), precision (88.12%), sensitivity (87.25%), and confusion matrix counts.

### `GET /api/roc-curve`
Returns authentic true positive and false positive rate coordinates from holdout evaluation.

### `POST /api/predict`
Accepts 11 standardized clinical biomarkers:
```json
{
  "Age": 54,
  "Sex": "M",
  "ChestPainType": "ASY",
  "RestingBP": 130,
  "Cholesterol": 240,
  "FastingBS": 0,
  "RestingECG": "Normal",
  "MaxHR": 145,
  "ExerciseAngina": "N",
  "Oldpeak": 1.0,
  "ST_Slope": "Flat"
}
```
Returns classification outcome, probability percentage, clinical description, contributing physiological indicators, recommended actions, and the **5 genuine nearest neighbors** from the training registry (`nearest_neighbors` with rank, Euclidean distance, diagnosis, and comparative biomarkers).
